			<p>The design for the 2011 Master of Interior Architecture Thesis Exhibition emphasizes the theme of adaptive re-use of existing structures which is central to the department's philosophy. The exhibit was organized as a timeline, guiding visitors along sixteen vacant and underused Providence buildings which are now transformed through studentss theses projects. The brown and white single-ply cardboard panels which make up the entire exhibition were pre-fabricated and assembled on location over a period of three days. The entire installation was recycled following the two-week exhibition period.</p>
